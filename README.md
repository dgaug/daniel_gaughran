first principles:

1. all principles are dynamic. if they do not change over time, then i will not have learned anything. my idols Munger, Buffet, and Marks set their firm's principles and did not change them. I do not purport to be this intelligent, even though sometimes i delude myself that i am. I hope that my principles change over time, especially over long periods.
